# Rider-Driver Interaction Test Scenarios

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Rider Request Flow

- **Initial Request**

  - Rider inputs pickup location
  - Rider inputs destination
  - Rider selects vehicle type (standard, premium, etc.)
  - System calculates estimated fare
  - Rider confirms request

- **Matching Process**

  - System searches for nearby available drivers
  - System considers driver ratings, distance, and vehicle type
  - System sends request to most suitable driver
  - Handle scenarios where no drivers are available

- **Request Status Updates**
  - Rider sees driver's response (accept/decline)
  - If declined, system tries next best driver
  - If accepted, show driver's current location and ETA

### 2. Driver Response Flow

- **Receiving Requests**

  - Driver receives ride request notification
  - Display pickup location and estimated fare
  - Timer for response window (accept/decline)
  - Handle multiple incoming requests

- **Trip Management**
  - Navigation to pickup location
  - Arrival notification to rider
  - Start trip confirmation
  - Route navigation to destination
  - End trip process

### 3. Real-time Updates

- **Location Tracking**

  - Continuous driver location updates
  - Route progress visualization
  - ETA updates
  - Handle connection interruptions

- **Communication**
  - In-app messaging between rider and driver
  - Push notifications for important updates
  - Emergency contact features

### 4. Payment Flow

- **Fare Calculation**

  - Base fare calculation
  - Time and distance factors
  - Surge pricing handling
  - Additional fees (tolls, waiting time)

- **Payment Processing**
  - Multiple payment method support
  - Transaction confirmation
  - Receipt generation
  - Handle failed payments

### 5. Post-Trip Actions

- **Rating System**

  - Rider rates driver
  - Driver rates rider
  - Feedback collection
  - Handle disputed ratings

- **Trip History**
  - Trip details storage
  - Receipt access
  - Lost items reporting

## Test Scenarios to Implement

1. **Basic Request Flow Test**

   - Test the complete flow from request to acceptance
   - Verify location input handling
   - Validate fare estimation

2. **Driver Matching Test**

   - Test driver selection algorithm
   - Verify multiple driver scenarios
   - Test timeout and rejection handling

3. **Real-time Updates Test**

   - Verify location update frequency
   - Test connection loss scenarios
   - Validate ETA calculations

4. **Payment Integration Test**

   - Test different payment methods
   - Verify fare calculations
   - Test payment failure scenarios

5. **Rating and Feedback Test**
   - Test rating submission
   - Verify feedback storage
   - Test rating display updates

Each test scenario will include:

- Initial setup requirements
- Test data preparation
- Expected outcomes
- Error scenarios to handle
- Success criteria
